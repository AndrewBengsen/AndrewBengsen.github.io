## Andrew Bengsen

I'm a widlife ecologist.  

My work is all about helping people to manage overabundant mammal populations to protect natural resources, agricultural production and human health.  

I use strong study design, powerful data analysis and solid logic to provide reliable and fit for purpose information...
