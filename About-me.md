### Wildlife Ecologist

My work is all about helping people to protect natural resources,
agricultural production and human health through the effective
management of overabundant mammal populations.

Poor or ineffective management wastes opportunity, time, money, energy,
animal lives, and social licence. Often, small changes to established
practice can make big differences to outcomes. This is what gets me out
of bed in the morning (often *waaaay* too early).

I use robust study design, powerful data analysis, and strong logical
and critcal thinking to provide reliable information in a way that
empowers people to make good, science-based wildlife management
decisions and get the results they need.

I’m currently focusing on developing and testing optimal disease
surveillance and response strategies for emergency animal disease
incursions in wild host populations. I’m also continuing work on feral
ungulate management and survey.

I also enjoy working with human behaviour researchers to understand how
we can remove barriers to effective management and provide resources and
conditions that promote great outcomes.

I love challenging assumptions and I’m always happy to have my prior
beliefs updated.
